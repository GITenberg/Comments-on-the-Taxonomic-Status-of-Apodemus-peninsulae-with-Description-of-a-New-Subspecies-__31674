<h2>Comments on the Taxonomic Status of Apodemus peninsulae, with<br />
Description of a New Subspecies from North China</h2>

<h4>BY<br />
J. KNOX JONES, JR.</h4>


<p>In the past several years the United States National Museum has received
a large number of mammals from central and southern Korea through the
auspices of the Commission on Hemorrhagic Fever of the Armed Forces
Epidemiological Board. Among these Korean collections are more than a
hundred specimens of a murine rodent originally described as "<i>Micromys
speciosus peninsulae</i>" by Oldfield Thomas but currently placed in the
genus <i>Apodemus</i>. In attempting to ascertain the specific relationships
of this mouse I have examined, through the generosity of Dr. David H.
Johnson, Acting Curator of Mammals, most of the other Oriental specimens
of the subgenus <i>Sylvaemus</i> in the U. S. National Museum and it is on
this combined material that the following comments and description are
based.</p>

<p>Three general groups of the genus <i>Apodemus</i> are presently known to
occur on the mainland of northeast Asia. One is the distinctive
<i>Apodemus agrarius</i>, lone representative of the subgenus <i>Apodemus</i>. The
others, both in the subgenus <i>Sylvaemus</i> and closely resembling each
other, are represented by a small animal that is currently regarded as
conspecific with <i>Apodemus sylvaticus</i> and a larger animal of which the
Korean mouse, <i>peninsulae</i>, is representative. The oldest trivial name
applied to the large <i>Sylvaemus</i> is <i>major</i> of Radde, 1862, in the
combination [<i>Mus sylvaticus</i>] vrt. <i>major</i>. This is, however, twice
preoccupied (see Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951:566). The next
available name is <i>peninsulae</i> of Thomas, 1907, which was applied to
mice from central and southern Korea (type from Mun'gyong, 110 mi. SE
Seoul, Korea), and was originally proposed as a subspecies of the
insular Japanese species, <i>Apodemus speciosus</i>. G. M. Allen (1940:949),
who recognized <i>peninsulae</i> as a monotypic species, was the first
investigator to make the important distinction that it was not
conspecific with the Japanese <i>speciosus</i>, although Hollister (1913:1-2)
and Miller (1914:89) had previously used the combination <i>Apodemus
peninsulae</i>, evidently with the same thought in mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>In comparing the ventral views of skulls note especially the size and
location of incisive foramina and posterior palatine foramina as well as
the breadth of mesopterygoid fossae. In comparing the left maxillary
tooth-rows note especially the size of M3 and the reduced
posterointernal cusp on Ml in <i>A. peninsulae</i>.]</p>

<p>More recently, Ellerman (1949:32) and Ellerman and Morrison-Scott
(1951:566) have arranged <i>peninsulae</i> as a subspecies of <i>Apodemus
flavicollis</i> under the assumption that all the members of the subgenus
<i>Sylvaemus</i> on the eastern Asiatic mainland are subspecies of one or
another of the species of western Europe, <i>A. flavicollis</i> or <i>A.
sylvaticus</i>. Ellerman (in Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951:564) states:
"The majority of the forms I distribute in a somewhat arbitrary manner
between <i>sylvaticus</i>, average smaller skull, and <i>flavicollis</i>, average
larger skull; occurring together nearly throughout the Palaearctic. I
feel fairly sure that there are some errors of judgment in my
arrangement, and equally sure that there is no other way to define
species in this very large and difficult group." I have compared the
specimens of <i>peninsulae</i> available to me from central and southern
Korea with specimens of <i>A. f. flavicollis</i> from Denmark, Germany and
Sweden and find, although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span> two are similar in many ways, that
<i>peninsulae</i> differs from <i>flavicollis</i> in several important characters:
Mammae 1-2=6 in <i>flavicollis</i>, and 2-2=8 in <i>peninsulae</i>; incisive
foramina reaching level of alveoli of M1, or nearly so, in
<i>flavicollis</i>, but ending conspicuously short of that level in
<i>peninsulae</i>; posterior palatine foramina large in <i>flavicollis</i> and
opposite a point where M1 and M2 meet, but small in <i>peninsulae</i> and
situated farther back on the palate, opposite M2. Moreover, <i>peninsulae</i>
lacks the characteristic buffy throat patch of <i>flavicollis</i>, has a much
reduced posterointernal cusp on the M1, a relatively (frequently
actually) larger M3 and, on the average, a broader mesopterygoid fossa.
In view of these differences, all of which appear to be constant, I
consider <i>peninsulae</i> specifically distinct from <i>flavicollis</i>.
Throughout its known geographic range (see below) <i>peninsulae</i> is
evidently confined to wooded terrain, either scrub or brush types or
forested areas, and the vernacular name wood mouse, therefore, seems
appropriate for this species.</p>

<p>The type specimens of <i>Apodemus praetor</i> Miller (type from Sungari
River, 60 mi. SW Kirin, Manchuria) and <i>Apodemus nigritalus</i> Hollister
(type from Tapucha, Altai Mountains, Siberia) agree with <i>peninsulae</i> as
concerns the above characters and differ from it only in minor external
and cranial features. They are, therefore, here considered as subspecies
of the latter.</p>

<p>Ellerman (1949:32) and Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951:567) regarded
<i>nigritalus</i>, like <i>peninsulae</i>, as a subspecies of <i>flavicollis</i>. The
subspecies <i>praetor</i>, on the other hand, has generally been regarded as
a synonym of <i>peninsulae</i> by recent authors. Howell (1929:58) noted that
the holotype was, "... a phenomenally large specimen such as is
encountered occasionally in almost all groups of rodents." He ascribed
the color differences noted by Miller to "seasonal" variation. The
holotype of <i>praetor</i> is undeniably larger than the other adult
specimens listed in the original description. These paratypes and other
specimens of <i>praetor</i> available to me are approximately the same size
externally and average only slightly larger cranially than specimens of
<i>peninsulae</i> from central and southern Korea. However, the dorsal
coloration of <i>praetor</i> is somewhat darker and duller than that of
<i>peninsulae</i>, especially in summer pelage when <i>praetor</i> lacks the
conspicuous bright ochraceous tinge of the Korean specimens. In
addition, <i>praetor</i> has broader zygomatic plates with correspondingly
deeper zygomatic notches and the color on the face of the upper incisors
averages much more orange than in <i>peninsulae</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>In the north then, wood mice range from Korea and Manchuria westward at
least as far as the Altai Mountains. For mice from the intervening
Siberian areas Russian workers have used the name <i>major</i> which, as
noted above, is unavailable. The exact relationships of the mice of
these areas to previously named subspecies is unknown to me and I have
not seen specimens of "<i>Mus (Alsomys) major rufulus</i>" of Dukelsky, 1928,
the type locality of which is 75 versts (approximately 50 miles) SE
Vladivostok, Siberia. It appears to be of the same species as
<i>peninsulae</i> and judging from the original description it closely
resembles <i>praetor</i>. Neither have I seen specimens of the Sakhalin
Island mouse, <i>giliacus</i>, which Ellerman (1949:32) regards as a
subspecies of <i>Apodemus sylvaticus</i>. I feel reasonably sure, however,
that it will prove to be a subspecies of <i>peninsulae</i>. In the original
description <i>giliacus</i> was referred to as, "Most closely allied to the
Korean subspecies..." (Thomas, 1907:411).</p>

<p>In China the extent of the distribution of <i>Apodemus peninsulae</i> is also
uncertain. Allen (1940:949-50) reported its occurrence from Jehol and
Hopeh in the northeast, southwestward through Shansi, Shensi and eastern
Kansu to Szechuan and northwestern Yunnan. Throughout most of this
region it occurs with another mouse, currently regarded as conspecific
with <i>Apodemus sylvaticus</i>, and the two kinds have been confused by some
previous authors. Howell (1929:58), for instance, reported twelve
specimens of <i>peninsulae</i> from 65-75 mi. NE Peking but my examination of
these mice indicates that only four are <i>peninsulae</i> while the others
are referrable to what is currently regarded as <i>Apodemus sylvaticus
draco</i>. Another subspecies of <i>sylvaticus</i>, <i>A. s. orestes</i>, occurs in
Szechuan and Yunnan and it is certain that some records of distribution
ascribed to <i>peninsulae</i> from those provinces actually represent
<i>orestes</i> (see Allen, 1940:949-50). <i>A. sylvaticus</i> is distinguishable
from <i>peninsulae</i> by darker ears, blackish preauricular patches, dark
eye rings, a noticeably smaller skull, incisive foramina that reach the
level of Ml (or nearly so), much larger auditory bullae, and a more
fully developed posterointernal cusp on M1. Too, <i>sylvaticus</i> typically
has 1-2=6 mammae although Allen reports finding a 2-2=8 formula in some
specimens. <i>Apodemus latronum</i>, regarded as a full species by Osgood
(1932:318) and G. M. Allen (1940:950) but as a subspecies of
<i>flavicollis</i> by Ellerman (1949:32) and Ellerman and Morrison-Scott
(1951:567), also occurs in Szechuan and Yunnan. Its relatively dark
color, large feet and large ears, <i>flavi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>collis</i>-like skull and large
molar teeth immediately separate it from <i>peninsulae</i> although the two
possibly have been confused in the earlier literature. Until a complete
revisionary study of the Asiatic members of the subgenus <i>Sylvaemus</i> can
be undertaken the presence of <i>peninsulae</i> in southwestern China must
remain in question.</p>

<p>The western limits of the geographic range of <i>Apodemus peninsulae</i> are
unknown. <i>Apodemus gurkha</i> Thomas, 1924, from Nepal is said to have
2-2=8 mammae but the description is not otherwise suggestive of close
relationship to <i>peninsulae</i>. Farther to the west, <i>Apodemus flavicollis
rusiges</i> Miller, 1913, from Kashmir seems to have been properly assigned
as a subspecies of <i>flavicollis</i> (cotypes and large series in USNM).</p>

<p>Wood mice almost certainly do not occur in the Gobi Desert. They are
known as far west as the Altai Mountains to the north of the Gobi and at
least as far west as Kansu (see below) to the south of it. Whether the
geographic range of the species skirts the western edge of the arid
regions of northern China is at present unknown; perhaps it does not. At
any rate, mice available to me from the North Chinese provinces of
Jehol, Shansi, Shensi and Kansu are notably different in certain
external and cranial features from other known races of <i>Apodemus
peninsulae</i> and are here given subspecific recognition. All measurements
are in millimeters. Capitalized color terms are from Ridgway (1912).</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Apodemus peninsulae peninsulae</i> (specimens from
various localities in central Korea), <i>A. p. sowerbyi</i> differs in:
External size smaller throughout, especially hind foot; upper parts,
especially in summer pelage, and dorsal aspect of tail paler;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span> skull
smaller and less massive; braincase proportionally more inflated;
rostrum shorter and noticeably down-curved. From <i>Apodemus peninsulae
praetor</i> of Manchuria (holotype and paratypes), <i>A. p. sowerbyi</i> differs
in most of the same ways in which it does from <i>peninsulae</i> as well as
in having more shallow zygomatic notches, narrower zygomatic plates and
smaller, more slender, upper incisors. From <i>Apodemus peninsulae
nigritalus</i> of the Altai Mountains of Siberia (holotype and paratypes),
<i>A. p. sowerbyi</i> differs in: Smaller size, both external and cranial;
paler dorsal coloration; less convex cranial outline in lateral view;
smaller auditory bullae.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Apodemus peninsulae sowerbyi</i> is named in honor of the late
Arthur de Carle Sowerby whose collections of mammals from North China
and Manchuria have added so much to our meager knowledge of that part of
the world.</p>

<p>Four specimens from Hsin-lung-shan, 65 mi. NE Peking, here assigned to
<i>sowerbyi</i>, are darker dorsally than mice from farther to the west and
in this respect may show approach to <i>A. p. praetor</i>. In all other
features, however, they closely resemble the new subspecies.</p>

<p>All of the specimens of <i>sowerbyi</i> available to me are from altitudes of
3000 feet or higher. At lower elevations in North China, destruction of
wooded habitats owing to intense land-use practices has probably
restricted the distribution of <i>sowerbyi</i> primarily to hilly and
mountainous areas where brushy, scrub and forest habitats still prevail.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Thirty-three, all from North China, as
follows: JEHOL: Hsin-lung-shan, 65 mi. NE Peking, 3000 ft., 4.
KANSU: 15 mi. S Lanchow, 7400 ft., 1. SHANSI: Chiao-cheng-shan, 90
mi. W Taiyuan, 7000-8000 ft., 4; 30 mi. W Kuei-hau-cheng, 7000 ft.,
5; Lung-wang-shan, 20 mi. E Taiyuan, 4000 ft., 10; 18 mi. W
Taiyuan, 5000 ft., 1; 50 mi. NW Taiyuan, 5500 ft., 4. SHENSI: 12
mi. S Yenan, 4000 ft., 4.</p></div>

<p><i>Apodemus peninsulae</i>, then, is known or suspected to occur over much of
southeastern Siberia, Manchuria, Korea and North China. The western
limits of its geographic range are unknown. Over this vast area only
four subspecies, one newly named, can be ascribed with certainty to
<i>peninsulae</i> whereas only two other kinds, <i>giliacus</i> of Thomas from
Sakhalin and <i>rufulus</i> of Dukelsky from extreme southeastern Siberia are
probably conspecific with it, the latter possibly a synonym of
<i>praetor</i>. These considerations underscore the preliminary nature of the
present paper. The mammalian fauna of northeastern Asia is scarcely
better known today than was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span> that of North America in 1885 when Dr. C.
Hart Merriam organized what was later to become the U. S. Biological
Survey.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the correct names of four kinds of wood mice
discussed above are as follows:</p>

<p>
<i>Apodemus peninsulae peninsulae</i> (Thomas, 1907)<br />
<i>Apodemus peninsulae nigritalus</i> Hollister, 1913<br />
<i>Apodemus peninsulae praetor</i> Miller, 1914<br />
<i>Apodemus peninsulae sowerbyi</i> Jones, 1956<br />

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
